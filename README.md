# Django Tutorial 
This is the collection of code I wrote while learing Django from the official documentation of django.
[Click Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/contents/) to go to the site.<br>
**Go to specific branches to get the code I wrote till that point.**
## Build
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install Django
```
